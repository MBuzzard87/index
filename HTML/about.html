                                <p class="description">“Hello, thank you for visiting my website!!! My name is Michael Buzzard and I'm aspiring to be a fulltime Software Developer.
                                I've been a Truck Driver since February 2008 working with FedEx and UPS. My passion for 
                                taking on difficult tasks as a Driver along with my self-awareness and light-hearted personality has helped me grow immensely and instilled traits in me
                                that have aided me as a Software Developer. What attracts me to Software Development is the constant pursuit for more knowledge and working in a field 
                                with no ceiling. My future goals are to build and maintain apps/software that hone in on people's needs and
                                undertake personal projects such as creating video games, mobile apps and marketplace websites. In my freetime I enjoy skateboarding, reading manga, playing video games,
                                soccer and spending time with my dog Shia. I would love to connect with you so please don't hesitate to reach out.”
